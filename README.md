# MoviesCookie- Taming CSS Chaos with React, TypeScript, and Bun

## About MoviesCookie

MoviesCookie is a web application designed to display and organize movie recommendations in a clean, responsive interface. With my CSS knowledge hovering near zero, I built this app to confront my styling struggles head-on. Using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the runtime, [React](https://react.dev/) for the front-end, and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety, I created a functional app while mastering modern CSS practices through relentless trial and error.

## Why I Created MoviesCookie

My CSS skills were a mess-misaligned elements, broken layouts, and mobile views that looked like a trainwreck. I needed a real project to force myself to learn CSS properly, and a movie app was the perfect challenge. MoviesCookie became my playground to experiment with React components, TypeScript’s type system, and CSS layouts, all powered by Bun’s lightning-fast development environment.

The app allows users to browse a curated movie list, view details, and save favorites. It’s not a Hollywood blockbuster, but it’s proof I went from CSS chaos to competence.

## Tech Stack

- **Bun**: JavaScript runtime and bundler for rapid setup, hot-reloading, and serving the React app.
- **React**: Component-based library for building a modular, dynamic UI.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static types to JavaScript for better code reliability and developer experience.
- **CSS**: The core focus, used to style components and create responsive, accessible layouts.
- **No CSS Frameworks**: Avoided frameworks like Tailwind to focus on raw CSS fundamentals.

## How I Built It

1. **Setting Up with Bun**: Initialized the project with Bun for its speed and simplicity. Bun’s `bun create --react` (with TypeScript support) set up a React app with hot-reloading, letting me iterate quickly while tweaking CSS.

2. **React + TypeScript Structure**: Built reusable components with TypeScript interfaces for props and state. Kept the component tree shallow and semantic for maintainability.
